/**
 * This class represents a employee, i.e., a user who uses the bike as a public transport 
 * in order to arrive at work.
 * Then, this user always decides the destination station just after renting the bike 
 * in order to arrive at work as soon as possible.
 * Moreover, he always chooses both the closest origin station to himself and the closest destination 
 * station to his work. Also, he always chooses the shortest routes to get the stations.
 * Also, this type of user always determines a new destination station after 
 * a reservation failed attempt and always decides to continue to the previously chosen 
 * station after a timeout event with the intention of losing as little time as possible.
 * And, of course, he never leaves the system as he needs to ride on bike in order to arrive at work.
